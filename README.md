## Introduction
The success of an NFL team counts on unpredictability, disguising or deciphering intentions pre-snap, on either side of the ball, is the game within the game.
My initial curiosity revolved around the variability of the tight end position, specifically whether a TE would run a route or stay in to block.
This interest was inspired by ***NFL Film Session, Episode 19 with Budda Baker***. [Link](https://youtu.be/7VgE3EyWUic?si=scZNL9ciq_yC1jjU&t=98)
In that episode, Brian Baldinger and Kurt Warner highlight a play in which Baker’s decision to blitz or drop into coverage depended on the TE he was assigned to cover, a concept they referred to as *Green Dog*.
After watching that episode, I envisioned a tool that could predict the assignment of any eligible receiver adding a layer of depth to a defender’s pre-snap reads and keys or to be used in a team's preparations from balancing their own tendencies to taking advantage of their opponents.
